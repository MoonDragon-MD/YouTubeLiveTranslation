# YouTubeLiveTranslation
JS-Script browser to translate live streams with youtube subtitles 

First install one of the addons:Violentmonkey, Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey

Then install my script and enjoy the translation.

To change target language change “target: 'it'” currently it is set to Italian.
