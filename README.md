# YouTubeLiveTranslation
JS-Script browser to translate live streams with youtube subtitles 

First install one of the addons:Violentmonkey, Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey

Then install my script and enjoy the translation.

To change target language change “target: 'it'” currently it is set to Italian.

If you want here is a youtube link of the live [Goodwood Festival of Speed 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnRHgwn5F8k)

Remember to enable the [LibreTranslate server](https://hub.docker.com/r/libretranslate/libretranslate) first and then the subtitles on the video

Usually the translation is available only after the live broadcast is over, while the live broadcast is in the original language with subtitles in that language (if available)

PS: If you have other scripts or addons for youtube they may conflict, so if you have problems disable them temporarily.
